**VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION:**

You must classify each finding into ONE of these categories:

**EXPLOITED** (Report in main section):
- Successfully executed exploit with concrete evidence
- Actual data extracted (usernames, passwords, table names, etc.)
- Reproducible proof-of-concept provided
- Clear demonstration of real-world impact
- Example: "Extracted 5 user records from Users table"

**POTENTIAL** (Report in separate section):
- Vulnerability indicators detected BUT exploitation blocked
- Blocker must be EXTERNAL constraint (not security control)
- Valid external blockers:
  * Server instability/crashes
  * Missing authentication that cannot be bypassed
  * Network/infrastructure issues
- Example: "SQL injection confirmed but requires valid session cookie we cannot obtain"

**FALSE POSITIVE** (Do NOT report):
- Security control successfully prevented exploitation
- Multiple bypass attempts all failed
- Generic errors with no vulnerability-specific indicators
- Theoretical vulnerability without any proof
- Example: "WAF blocked all SQL injection attempts after testing 15 different bypasses"

**CRITICAL DISTINCTION:**
- If a WAF, input filter, or other SECURITY MEASURE blocks exploitation → FALSE POSITIVE
- If an EXTERNAL FACTOR (not designed for security) blocks exploitation → POTENTIAL

When in doubt, classify as FALSE POSITIVE rather than POTENTIAL.
