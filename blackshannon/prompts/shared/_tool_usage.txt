**HTTP Client:**
- Purpose: Send HTTP/HTTPS requests with custom headers, payloads
- When to use: For all injection testing, fingerprinting, data extraction
- Example: Send SQL injection payload to /api/search?q=

**Browser Automation:**
- Purpose: Interact with web pages requiring JavaScript, handle authentication
- When to use: XSS testing, complex authentication flows, JavaScript-heavy apps
- Example: Login with 2FA, inject XSS in rich text editor

**Response Analyzer:**
- Purpose: Compare responses, detect patterns, identify error messages
- When to use: Boolean blind SQLi, differential analysis, WAF detection
- Example: Compare response lengths for ' OR '1'='1 vs ' AND '1'='2

**Timing Analyzer:**
- Purpose: Measure response times for time-based attacks
- When to use: Time-based blind SQL injection, race conditions
- Example: Test if SLEEP(5) causes 5-second delay

**Tool Selection Strategy:**
1. Start with HTTP Client for most testing
2. Use Browser Automation when JavaScript execution needed
3. Use Analyzers to make sense of complex responses
4. Escalate to external tools (sqlmap) only after 10+ manual attempts fail

**Tool Call Format:**
Always provide complete, reproducible commands with full URLs and payloads.
